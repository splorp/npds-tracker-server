NPDS Tracker Server was written by Victor Rehorst <http://www.chuma.org/> and Paul Guyot <http://kallisys.com/>, with additional contributions by Manuel Probsthain and Grant Hutchinson <http://splorp.com/>.

Many thanks to Matt Vaughn <http://chromatin.cshl.edu/vaughn/> for developing NPDS in the first place.

Requirements

-----------------------------------------------------------


Sun Java 1.1 or better

	Java 1.3 or higher is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED due to DNS caching bugs in 
	prior Java versions.  If you have to use Java 1.2 there is a 
	workaround: add the parameter "-Dsun.net.inetaddr.ttl=0" to the 
	Java command-line.

A connection to the internet

	NPDSTracker has an official TCP port assigned by the IANA: 3680.
	Many trackers also listen on port 80 or 8080.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Basic Configuration

-----------------------------------------------------------


* Assuming you already have the Java SDK setup properly, open a command line
and compile the server:

	javac npdstracker.java

* Edit npdstracker.ini and change any settings you see fit. Pay attention to
the log settings - NPDSTracker logs are rather verbose and can become quite
large over time. You can turn logging off in the INI file once you are sure
your server is configured properly.  Also add any trackers which you want to
share records with.

* Start the server at the command line:

	java npdstracker

or, for Java 1.2.x:

	java -Dsun.net.inetaddr.ttl=0 npdstracker

* Test connecting to the server.  Fire up a web browser and point it to

	http://<server IP/hostname>:3680/

* Configure and NPDS server to point to the tracker and make sure it can 
register.


-----------------------------------------------------------

Advanced Configuration

-----------------------------------------------------------


The basic configuration is great for development, testing, and Windows 
deployment, but for those running Linux or Mac OS X, it's preferable to
install npdstracker more permanently and appropriately. Specifically:

* For a cleaner installation, create a JAR file at the command line:

	jar cvf npdstracker.jar *.class

* Install the JAR file to /usr/local/bin from at the command line:

	mkdir -p /usr/local/bin
	install npdstracker.jar /usr/local/bin

* Install the npdstracker.ini & npdscmd.txt files in /etc at the command 
line:

	mkdir -p /etc/npdstracker
	install npdstracker.ini npdscmd.txt /etc/npdstracker

* Install the template.html & template.css files in /usr/local/share at the 
command line:

	mkdir -p /usr/local/share/npdstracker
	install template.html template.css /usr/local/share/npdstracker

* Create the log file at the command line:

	touch /var/log/npdstracker.log

* Edit /etc/npdstracker/npdstracker.ini to point to the new paths for all 
the aforementioned files, especially:

	pageTemplate = /usr/local/share/npdstracker/template.html
	cssTemplate = /usr/local/share/npdstracker/template.css
	logfile = /var/log/npdstracker.log

* You can now manually start npdstracker at the command line:

	java -cp /usr/local/bin/npdstracker.jar npdstracker -c /etc/npdstracker/npdscmd.txt -o /etc/npdstracker/npdstracker.ini

* Or, on Darwin/Mac OS X, you can create a launch daemon to automatically start 
npdstracker on boot by creating & editing /Library/LaunchDaemons/fr.free.npds.npdstracker.plist
and pasting in the following (this is assuming following the above Advanced 
Configuration steps):

	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
	<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
	<plist version="1.0">
		<dict>
			<key>Label</key>
			<string>fr.free.npds.npdstracker</string>
			<key>ProgramArguments</key>
			<array>
				<string>java</string>
				<string>-cp</string>
				<string>/usr/local/bin/npdstracker.jar</string>
				<string>npdstracker</string>
				<string>-c</string>
				<string>/etc/npdstracker/npdscmd.txt</string>
				<string>-o</string>
				<string>/etc/npdstracker/npdstracker.ini</string>
			</array>
			<key>KeepAlive</key>
			<dict>
				<key>NetworkState</key>
				<true/>
			</dict>
			<key>RunAtLoad</key>
			<true/>
		</dict>
	</plist>

It can be loaded immediately by running the following at the command line, or 
you can wait until the next reboot:

	sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/fr.free.npds.npdstracker.plist

* Or, on Linux or BSD systems you can create init.d or rc.d scripts,
respectively, to automatically start npdstracker on boot.


-----------------------------------------------------------

Page Template Tag Syntax

-----------------------------------------------------------

(Moved from the npdstracker.ini file)

The HTML template can use the following pseudo XML tags:


<hit-counter/>

	The number of hits since last restart

<http-doc/>

	What comes after the GET (usually "/")

<last-validation/>

	Last validation: <foo> or "Validation is in progress."

<meta-refresh/>

	The meta-HTTP equiv refresh line (remark: the refresh line is sent in the HTTP headers)

<servers/>

	The list of NPDS servers formatted as a table

<server-counter/>

	The number of registered NPDS servers

<stylesheet/>

	Inserts the stylesheet specified by npdstracker.ini (default: template.css)

<url/>

	The URL of this server (used reading the host header, useful for W3C syntax check button)

<validate-time/>

	The time (in minutes) between validations

<version/>

	The current version (e.g. 0.1.35)
